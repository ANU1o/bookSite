# Permanent Storage

>**Variable** Stores data temporarily

For permanent data storage database is being used. In this course we will use **mongo db**.

As for now we will utilize localStorage for data saving and retrieval.

## Local Storage

>It is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. 
>
>This means the data stored persists even after the user closes the browser or restarts the computer.

One major drawback of localStorage is **low storage capacity**. Therefore it can only be used for temporary storage.
